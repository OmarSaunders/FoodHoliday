1. 🎯 Business Use Case
Problem Statement
The core request from our client was for a comprehensive and dynamic source of information pertaining to various culinary and food traditions. She specifically emphasized a need for insights beyond her existing knowledge base, indicating a desire for novel and diverse perspectives on global food culture.
To address this, the client articulated a clear preference for a system that could proactively deliver relevant information. Her stated methods for receiving these updates included either direct email notifications or alerts prompting her to visit a dedicated online platform. The primary objective of these notifications is to provide her with the necessary and timely information she requires to stay abreast of various food-related holidays, celebrations, and cultural practices. This suggests a need for a solution that is both informative and convenient, minimizing the effort required on her part to access the desired content.
