# FoodHoliday
365 Days of Food Holidays

This project is a tribute to my beautiful wife that happens to be a Pastry Chef and Content Creator. She always wanted to keep help of the all of the food holidays as she found some of them so adorable to mention. I created this Python Application to send her daily emails of Today's food holiday. This Python Script was turned into a cloud function. I also used Secrets Manager (Used to protect the email addresses and passwords) as well Cloud Scheduler to create a cron job to deliver the email at 7:00 AM each and every day
